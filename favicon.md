# Update the Favicon

Changing the default favicon of a Next.js application is one of the first things you can do when branding your website.

The demo app includes two favicons: the default Next.js one (`public/favicon2.ico`) and the McMaster favicon (`public/favicon.ico`), which was downloaded from the [McMaster University Brand Standards Website Favicon Folder](https://brand-resources.mcmaster.ca/asset-bank/action/browseItems?categoryId=1516&categoryTypeId=2&cachedCriteria=1).

To change the favicon of your SPA, open the `app/layout.tsx` file and modify the `metada` constant by changing the `icon` attribute to `/favicon.ico` as shown below:

```
export const metadata: Metadata = {
    title: 'RSD Workshop App',
    description: 'Generated by create next app',
    viewport: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1',
    icons: {
        icon: '/favicon2.ico',
    },
}
```

Default Favicon          |  McMaster Favicon
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![old-favicon](assets/img/old-favicon.png)  |  ![new-favicon](assets/img/new-favicon.png)

Since browsers often cache website favicons, you may need to clear your browser cache or open the website in an incognito window for the updated icon to appear.
