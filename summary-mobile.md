In the second part of this workshop, we learned how to optimize a Next.js SPA for mobile devices by scaling its components to fit properly on small screens. Our mobile-friendly SPA includes:
- An adaptive footer that changes its layout and position according to the display size
- An adaptive navigation bar that makes use of a drawer on mobile devices
- Responsive buttons that shrink on mobile devices
- Vertical tabs that are automatically moved to a drawer on mobile devices
