# AODA Compliance 

The Information and Communications Standard is part of the AODA Integrated Standards Regulation released in June 2011 by the Ontario legislative body. It requires McMaster University to provide information in an accessible format, which includes web sites and information published on them. In this section, we will learn how to evaluate a website for AODA compliance and how to address some common AODA errors related to MUI components.

### Installing the Wave Browser Extension
Open the [WAVE Extensions ](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) webpage and install the Wave extension for the browser that you are currently using. 

### Using the Wave Browser Extension
To evaluate a page, simply click on the extension button in your browser's toolbar.

The Wave sidebar will be shown on the left side of your browser. The sidebar includes a summary of all the errors, alerts and features that are present on the page you have open.

You will need to evaluate all pages of your website across their different variations using this tool. For instance, if your website has a light and a dark mode, you will need to evaluate each page in both modes. Furthermore, if you have some UI elements that only appear in certain conditions (e.g., mobile/tablet UI, etc.), you will will have to evaluate each page in all its variations.
