# AODA Compliance

The Information and Communications Standard is part of the AODA Integrated Standards Regulation released in June 2011 by the Ontario legislative body. It requires McMaster University to provide information in an accessible format, which includes web sites and information published on them. In this section, we will learn how to evaluate a website for AODA compliance and how to address some common AODA errors related to MUI components.

## Pre-workshop Setup

If you did not attend the "Mobile UI" workshop, you will need to clone the `wsr_web-design-guide` repo using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/McMasterRS/wsr_web-design-guide.git
```

Then, checkout the `aoda` branch using the following command or using the IDE GUI:
```
git checkout aoda
```
