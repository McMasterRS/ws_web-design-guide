## Goal of this workshop

The goal of this workshop is to learn how to style **some** MUI components using the McMaster Digital Branding Guidelines. You will not be an expert on MUI by the end of the class and this is okay. We want to cover the basics of MUI styling, but as with any skill, mastering it takes practice. You will also learn the basics of mobile user interface design as well as how to use the Wave tool to evaluate your website for AODA compliance.

### Learning Objectives

At the end of this workshop, attendees will be able to:

- Style a Next.js application with MUI components
- Use the recommended McMaster typography fonts and styles
- Style common interactive UI elements like buttons, speed dials and file input widgets
- Modify MUI components to scale properly on small screen devices
- Evaluate your website for AODA compliance using the WAVE tool and fix common accessibility errors
